        <h2>Welcome to Sea Shore</h2>
        <p>A beach is a magical place where land meets the sea. Itâ€™s a place filled with golden sand that feels warm and soft under your feet. The waves of the sea come and go, leaving behind pretty seashells and sometimes. The sea can be calm, its water clear and blue, where you can see small fish swimming near the shore. </p>
